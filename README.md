# Minix
Minix is a Programming Language Made by Me, its FREE and OPEN-SOURCE, It Basically just translates From mx to Python,
Minix is Basically just Python +  GDScript, yes I Chose the 2 easiet
Languages that our out there, And the Minix Extention is .mx

It Works on Every os that Has Python Install, there is a chance im gonna make a .exe version

# How to Use
use log() to print a string / integer on the screen.
use func to define a Function, then use reguler python terms
use string() to convert something to a string
use interger() to convert something to an int
use ret to return
use rand_integer() to get a random number for X to X
use rand_string() to get a random string from a list
to create a list just do VARNAME = [LISTITEMS], just like in Python
and you can still use other normal Python stuff like Importing libs
make sure the .mx file is in the same directory as the .exe file.

# Installation
## for Windows
just download the minix.py and make sure you have Python.,
make sure you have python cause it depends on it,
and make sure the .mx file is at the same directory as the .exe and .dll file.
